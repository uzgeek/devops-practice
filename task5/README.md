# Task Five


## Question:
- install any web server: apache/caddy/nginx and enable all log level
- try to overload it for 100% with any HTTP requests (curl, bash etc), even with missing pages/methods
- after 10-15 minutes of stress test download a log file locally
- analyze log file with AWK/GREP/TAIL/CAT utilities. Something like "show only info level", "show all GET requests"


## To overload server and download log file run the script
``` bash script.sh ```

## To get analyses run the script
``` bash analyze.sh ```
